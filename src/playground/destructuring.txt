*******************ES6 object Destructuring*******************
    ->const book = {
            title : 'Ego is the Enemy',
            author : 'Ryan Holiday',
            publisher :  {
                name : 'Penguin'
            }
        };

        *Destructuring : this is ES6 syntax and it allow us to easly work with arrays and object 
        *advantages of Destructuring : 
            -simplefiy the syntax into sigle line code when we trying to save the object property
             into it's variable

        *Object destructuring we use curly braces

    ->const title = person.title;
      const author = person.author;
      //destructuring syntax
      const { title, author } = book. 

            -also can give the another name to the object property while destructuring then we use that 
            object property by its new name.

    ->const  { name:publisher_Name } = book.publisher;
    ->console.log(`and it publish by ${publisher_Name}`);

            -we can provide default vlaue also in while destructuring.
        
    ->const  { name:publisher_Name = 'Self-Publisher' } = book.publisher;

*******************ES6 Array Destructuring*******************

    ->const item = [
                undefined,
                '$2.00',
                '$2.50',
                '$2.75'
            ]

        *Array destructuring we use square braces
        *array match the value by position
        *we can give default value while array destructuring in the case of empty array or in the place of undefined
        *destructur skip that value
                                     |
    ->const [itemName = 'coffee (hot)', , medium] = address;
      console.log(`A medium ${itemName} costs ${medium}`);
